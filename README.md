# Death Saving Throw Webapp

### [ON DEVELOPMENT]

This is a death saving throw (DST) webapp based on Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) 5e RPG system.

## Objective

As a D&D Dungeon's Master (DM), I enjoy rolling DST for my players myself. So, I would like to make it easier to track all rolls inside a simple tool, once I play most on virtual table tops.

## Features

-   Add unlimited players
-   Mark all failures and sucessess on DSTs
-   Player status (risk of death, dead and alive)
-   Clear one or all DSTs

## Stack

-   Vue 3
-   Tailwind CSS
-   Pinia
