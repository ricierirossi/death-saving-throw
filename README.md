# Death Saving Throw Webapp

This is a death saving throw webapp based on Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) 5e RPG system.

## Objective

As a D&D Dungeon's Master, I enjoy rolling death saving throws for my players myself. So, I would like to make it easier to track all rolls inside a simple tool, once I play most on virtual table tops.

## Features

-   Add and remove players
-   Roll saving throw die (pseudo random)
-   Mark all failures and sucessess on saving throws
-   Player's status (risky, dead, alive and a famous cat)
-   Clear one or all saving throws
-   Save data on local storage

## Stack

-   Vue 3
-   Tailwind CSS
-   Pinia
