# Death Saving Throw Webapp

### [ON DEVELOPMENT]

A death saving throw (DST) webapp based on Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) 5e RPG system.

## Objective

As a D&D Dungeon's Master (DM), I enjoy rolling DST for my player myself. So, I would like to make it easier to track all rolls inside a simple tool, once I play most on virtual table tops.

## Features

-   Add unlimited players
-   Mark all failures and sucessess on DST
-   Player status (death or alive)
-   Clear one or all DST

## Stack

-   Vue 3
-   Tailwind CSS
